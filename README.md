# Iron Mecca
A front-end application for a mock gym/fitness commercial website, built using React.js, TypeScript and TailwindCSS. This application does not have a backend, meaning refreshing the page will cause the shopping cart to clear and all other state to be lost. 

## Third Party Services
- [OpenStreetMap API](https://www.openstreetmap.org) was used to display the location of each gym. 
- [Formspree API](https://formspree.io) was used to handle SMTP config/outbound emails. 
- [Stripe API](https://stripe.com) was used to the handle the checkout stage and transaction processing. TBC

 - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
